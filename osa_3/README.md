# osa_3

Phonebook's backend is in it's own [repo](https://github.com/SleepModezZ/plBackend).
There were some small changes to the [frontend](https://github.com/SleepModezZ/full_stack/tree/master/osa_2/puhelinluettelo) during this part, but I kept the code still in part_2 of this repo.
And, finally, the Heroku app is working [here](https://radiant-retreat-63139.herokuapp.com/).
